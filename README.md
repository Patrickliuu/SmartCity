# SmartCity

Use the UWO dataset to do data science in a smart city.

## Setup instructions

1. Install Anaconda (<https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>) or Miniconda
1. To create the environment, run `conda env create -f environment.yml`; this installs the package for
editing, so that the imports work as expected
1. To activate this environment, run `conda activate SmartBuilding`
1. Maybe run `conda update --all` to let Conda attempt to resolve any potential inconsistencies in the environment after installing using pip.
1. To build the documentation, change to the `docs` directory and run `make html`. The documentation can then be found in the `docs/build/html/index.html` file.


## Further documentation

To view more detailled documentation, build the doc as mentioned above and look at the `docs/build/html/index.html` file. Start reading the `Getting started` section.
